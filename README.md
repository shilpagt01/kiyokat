# Mini project

IoT based forest fire warning system using Nodemcu 

# Hardware Requirements
- Nodemcu (microcontroller)
- Ultrasonic sensor
- DHT11
- Soil moisture sensor

# Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE
- Thingspeak
- IFTTT

# Project Description

Forest fire is getting worse for all these days which can be detected and predicted using NodeMCU based on IoT. 
In this project, a temperature sensor, DTH11 humidity sensor is interfaced to NodeMCU detects the temperature and humidity produced from the fire. 
The values are taken from the Sensor and is uploaded to the cloud i.e. in Thingspeak. 
Using threshold value, the temperature and humidity value is taken into consideration and an analysis is made to detect fire. 
When it is detected an email triggered with an alert message with the sensor values and the fire is predicted.
